# Instacart-basket-analysis
This project aims to predict customer reorder behaviors using machine learning models based on the Instacart Market Basket dataset. By applying Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Deep Learning, we identify products likely to be reordered, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction through personalized recommendations. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and cross-validation were used to ensure model robustness and accuracy. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest provided the most balanced results, indicating their suitability for retail environments. Future work will focus on improving model efficiency and exploring real-time deployment for enhanced user experiences.
